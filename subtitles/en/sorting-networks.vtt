00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.000
[Sorting Networks]

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.360
So we've come outside today
to learn a little bit more about how computers work,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.160
and what we have is, this is like a
supercomputer made out of chalk.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.919
And I'm gonna show you why in a moment,
I need six volunteers.

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:26.150
Awesome.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.710
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you a
disk, and you need to go and stand on the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.430
circles - the far far away ones.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.830
So Rhylee you go away over
in that far away one.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.090
Robert you go into the next one.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.900
Ellie you go over to that next one.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.150
Kourash can you go over there.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.629
Lewis can you go into the last one.

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:48.629
Okay!

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.219
So I've got you guys here and this is all
about teamwork.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.850
And it's all about organising data.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.460
So you guys are the start of the data you're
coming in and you're all out of order, we've

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.460
got the number 5, number 2, number 1,
number 3, number 6 and number 4.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.680
And so before we start going into the supercomputer,
all I need to teach you is this symbol here.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.900
What does this symbol here mean?

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.479
What does it mean Lewis?

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.420
Smaller then bigger.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.940
Smaller then bigger what's some more mathematical
terms that we could use for smaller and bigger

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.200
-- yep?
-- Less than or greater than

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.100
Less than or greater than. Awesome, so what
we have is the orange line is the less than,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.940
and the blue line is the greater than.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.560
So let's see how this works. Can you all
take a step into the box.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.980
Can you say hi to the person next to you and
give them a big smile.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.100
Not too cheesy.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.500
Now what you need to do is decide: have I
got the bigger number

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.600
or have I got the smaller number.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.100
And then the bigger number
follows the blue line,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.400
the smaller number follows the orange line, go.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.320
Now, you need to look around and check everyone's
there and then you need to say hi and give

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.000
the person a big smile go.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.960
Now decide who's got the smaller, who's got
the greater number.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.640
Do you guys know what to do?

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.810
Do the next one I didn't see anyone smiling
and saying hello, smile and say hello.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.810
Hi.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.980
Now make your decision go.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.260
Hello!

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.120
Nice.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.660
What number do you have?

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.880
I have 4 so I'll go this way.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.860
Perfect.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.040
Cool so I'm gonna get you guys to turn and
face me this way and we're gonna see what

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.860
happened to our numbers, can you turn and
hold up your numbers please?

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.000
Oh, wow Kourash what number have you got?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.360
-- One.
-- What number have you got Lewis?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.360
Two.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.100
Three.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.640
Four.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.540
Five.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.280
Six.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.060
Okay what just happened to our numbers?

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.520
We put them into our supercomputer that's
chalk that's like a supercomputer,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.480
and we processed it and what happened?

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.980
We came back in the right order.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.680
Oh, do you think that would work with everything?
[Tip: This activity can be used to sort anything!]

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.600
Yes.
[Tip: This activity can be used to sort anything!]

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.840
What kind of things
could we sort in order do you think?

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.740
-- Yep?
-- Books.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.060
We could sort books, what else?

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.220
Letters?

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.240
Yes, what else?

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.080
Bells?

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.100
Yes, what else?

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.700
Notes.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.400
Yes, what else?

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.400
What about big numbers?

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.690
Really big numbers could we do that?

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.020
-- Yes.
-- Yep, cool.

[Handbells (musical pitch, higher or lower)]

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.440
Which one sounds lower and which one's higher?

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.420
I'm lower.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.040
You're lower, sweet.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.020
Okay, let's sound one at a time.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.100
Yep. Which one sounds lower?

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.560
This one's lower.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.100
Yep, let's try play it once more to make sure.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.500
That's sounds good.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.240
Let's hear it, let's hear it one more time.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.560
Yep.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.480
Okay, keep going.
