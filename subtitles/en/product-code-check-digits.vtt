00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.460
[Product code check digits]

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.620
Cool, so the last lesson we did we looked at

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.060
how computers can detect errors
and correct them.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.380
Hand's up if you've ever been to the supermarket
and you've scanned in your groceries

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.920
and it comes up with the grocery items?

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.260
Have you guys done that?

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.940
Yeah?

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:33.160
Hands down, so what happens when you've scanned
it and it isn't reading properly?

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.240
What does the checkout person do?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.540
Or what would the checkout person do?

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.460
You have to ask them and they'll scan something?

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.460
Yeah, they do scan something, and sometimes
they have to key in something don't they?

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.320
It just can't be read because it might be
folded and so they have to do something

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.460
what do they have to do?

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.980
Don't they have that on their key, don't they
have that little barcode thingymabob.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.760
-- They do they do.
-- And don't they scan that on the machine

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.720
and it sorta--

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.420
They do but that still doesn't tell us
what the product is.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.020
So at the bottom of a product you've got the
barcode right; the black and the white?

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.480
But then you've got some numbers underneath.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.080
And those numbers have a thing
called a checksum at the end.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.840
Yep?

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.180
You sort of have a barcode that will be a
bit smaller so you can put it in as a person.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.420
Yeah yeah absolutely.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.180
So they have to type in the numbers because
they just can't read it right?

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.300
And so that last number is called a checksum
and I'm gonna teach you guys today how it works.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.539
Dylan, could you just go and get something
from the back of the classroom there that's

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.260
got a 13 digit barcode for us, 
and we'll see how it works.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.280
Cool, so call out the numbers loud and proud
but I don't want to know the 13th number.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.180
I only want to know the 12 digits before that.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:12.780
9, 3, 1, 0, 4, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4 and 5.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.580
Okay I'm just gonna read that back to you
can you double check that for me?

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:26.800
9, 3, 1, 0, 4, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.560
True?

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.569
Cool.

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.310
Okay so now we've got these numbers up on
the board what I need you guys to do is to

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.879
help me add up just this top row.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.280
-- So 9+1 is?
-- 10.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.220
-- 10+4 is?
-- 14.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.760
-- 14+2 is?
-- 16.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.580
-- 16+4 is?
-- 20.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.050
And we're only interested in the ones column,
so what number in 20 is in the ones column?

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.050
Sam?

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.050
2.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.360
That's in the tens good try.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.360
Zero?

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.230
Zero, so we're just gonna record the zero
here.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.069
Because that's the only number
we're interested in.

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.980
Now we're gonna add up the bottom column.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.360
-- 3+0 is?
-- 3.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.880
-- 3+9 is?
-- 12.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.120
-- 12+0 is?
-- 12, 12.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.560
-- 12+5 is?
-- 17.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.790
17 but we're only interested in the ones column?

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.060
7.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.260
Now the bottom one we're gonna times by 3,
but here's the trick.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.060
We're only interested in the ones column.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.400
What's 7x3 and what's the
value in the ones column?

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.900
Freddy.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.000
1.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.340
Who else got 1?

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.600
Cool.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.880
It is equal to 1.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.520
What's 0+1?

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.400
1.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.280
Cool.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.240
Now, if I had to
make 0 - which is really 10 - right?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.040
'Cause we're only interested in the ones column.

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.459
If I had to make 0, what would be that
missing number in there?

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.880
Zero?

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.340
One plus what makes 10?

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.620
9.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.180
The checksum is 9.

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.659
True or false?

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.500
True.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.000
Cool.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.840
So that's the mathematical equation that's
underneath every single barcode, right?

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.520
Okay, so let's have a look at what happens
if I heard something wrong.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.380
Let's say that I heard the 4 as a 5.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.680
So the first thing that would change is this,
would this be a zero still?

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.460
-- No.
-- What would that become?

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.460
1.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.320
Okay which then changes
1+1 isn't 1 anymore, what is it?

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.060
2.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.520
That becomes 2.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.920
So 2 plus what makes 10?

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.180
Is it 9?

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.040
No.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.420
It becomes 8.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:54.160
And so because I typed in one number wrong,
the checksum is incorrect,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.200
and it beeps back at you to say it's not right.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.520
And so you have to type the number in again.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.360
And because we're people, what do you think
the most common mistake is

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.280
when we're typing in numbers?

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.000
What's the thing we would get wrong the most?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.770
-- Robert?
-- The number.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.200
Yeah the number, what would we do with the
numbers that would make it different?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.320
Might not write them all?

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.900
Yeah what, would I read the number wrong?

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.910
What would I do?

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.410
You might put instead of the 1, instead of
it being 9, 1, it might be 1, 9.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.750
Yeah, so did you notice, that this was the
first number, this was the second number,

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.690
this is the first number,
this is the second number.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:44.240
The reason for that is, is that the most common
mistakes we make is we swap these around.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.800
I might read 93, but my fingers type in 39.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.800
True?  Have you ever done that when you're typing?

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.840
And you get your letters around
the wrong way?

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:00.100
And that's the kind of thing: this checksum
stops us from going in

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:06.520
to buy a pack of Pokemon cards and getting charged for a solar panel robot kit.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.280
True?
