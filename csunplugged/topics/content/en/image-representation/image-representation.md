# Image Representation

Images are everywhere on computers and digital devices, and they are one of the main ways we interact with them.
Digital devices store everything using digits, so how do they use these digits to create the images we see on our computer screens, our smartphones, and our tablets?
How do these devices convert a long list of digits into photos, video game graphics, and web pages?
This unit will explore how we can represent pictures and colours using binary digits, how these are displayed using pixels on a screen, and why the way we represent these images changes what we see.
