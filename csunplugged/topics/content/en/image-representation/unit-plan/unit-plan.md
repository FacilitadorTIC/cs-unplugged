# Image Representation

**We recommend completing lesson 1 (for the relevant age group) of the [Binary Numbers unit]('topics:unit_plan' 'binary-numbers' 'unit-plan') before beginning this unit.**


Images are everywhere on computers and digital devices.
If you think of all the different devices you use and what you do with them, it is likely that almost all of these will involve a screen of some kind!
Everything you see on computer screens, whether it is photographs, videos, websites, even text, is an image that a digital device has been programmed to display.

All information that modern computers store and process is stored as digits, using binary digits.
This means that everything you see in computer images is stored inside a computer using just 0's and 1's, and these are used to *represent* images.

Computer screens are divided into a grid of tiny squares called pixels.
These pixels can each show a different colour, and because they are so small when we look at a screen we don't see the individual pixels, instead we see them blend together into an image.
If you look very very closely at a computer or TV screen (especially older ones) then you might be able to see these individual pixels. Be careful not to hurt your eyes though!

The digits stored in the computer tell each of these pixels what colour they should be and when they should change colour, which means computers can turn a bunch of random looking binary digits into all the beautiful images we see on our screens!

## Vocabulary Explained

### Pixel

The word pixel is abbreviation of *picture element*. On computer screens (and printers) an image is almost always displayed using a grid of tiny coloured squares, called pixels.


{comment Older version, which matches the pixels.md file in the glossary: This term is an abbreviation of picture element, the name given to the tiny squares that make up a grid that is used to represent images on a computer.}


### Display Resolution

The resolution of a screen refers to the number or density of pixels on the screen.
It is usually defined as either the number of pixels per inch on the screen, or the width x height of the screen measured in pixels (e.g. 1920x1080 pixels).


## Real world implications

{comment Check conventions around using numerals vs words}

The more bits we use to store the colour of a pixel, the more different colours we can make.
If we use one bit to store the colour of a pixel then we only have two options for what that colour can be (remember, with one bit we can represent two different values only, because we can only use 0 or 1).
If we use 8 bits (or 1 byte) then we can represent 256 different colours instead, which



- Screen resolutions


- File sizes and image quality


- Image processing time. Need better hardware to run newer games, streaming quality, matters a lot for creators and artists.




## Reflection questions

- What was most surprising about the learning that happened from the teaching of this unit?
- Who were the students who were very systematic in their activities?
- Who were the students who were very detailed in their activities?
- What would I change in my delivery of this unit?
