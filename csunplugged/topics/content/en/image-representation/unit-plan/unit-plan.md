# Image Representation

Computers today use digits to represent information - that's why they're called digital systems.
But we use computers to store, display, and manipulate many different types of data, not just digits.


This unit will include some discussions about, and use of, binary so we recommend completing lesson 1 of the Binary Numbers unit before beginning this unit.
