## Key questions

- How can computers store images efficiently so that they take up less space?

## Lesson starter

In this lesson we will again just be looking at black and white images (this makes learning the CS concepts much simpler, and following lessons move on to coloured images).

Remind students about what they learnt in the previous lesson, that digital images are made up of pixels and computers store the colour of pixels using binary digits (bits).

# Notes on resources

- Print spare copies of each worksheet in case students make mistakes and need a new one.
- Use the **Black and White (2 possible binary values) in in Run Length Encoding** option.
- Students can use a black colouring pencil, crayon, or felt tip pen, but easily erasable pencils work much better for the first time students do this activity.
