# Colour by numbers

{comment May need to split this into two seperate lessons for jnr vs snr}

{comment Need to figure out how to properly link to resources, then add in pixel painter}

.

## Key question

- How do computers represent images when they can only store numbers?


## Lesson starter

Print pixel painter sheets. In the Colouring type list choose the first option 'Black and White (2 possible binary values)'.
Choose one of the images from the list, ideally one of the 6 or 8 page options to start with.

{comment Maybe suggest doing the activity as a group first?}


{comment Maybe have a really simple one for the teacher to demonstrate with? Like a letter, as in the classic CSU.}

# Notes on resources

A normal writing pencil or black colouring pencil.
Erasers - These are good to have as students will likely make some mistakes.

## Applying what we have just learnt




## Lesson reflection


This is just for black and white images, but what about coloured ones? We will explore this at older ages.
