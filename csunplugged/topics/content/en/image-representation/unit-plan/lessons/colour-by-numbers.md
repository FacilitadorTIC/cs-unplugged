# Colour by numbers

{comment Do learning outcomes at some point. They go in the yaml file}

## Key questions

- How do you think computers display images on a screen?
- How do computers represent images when they can only store numbers?


## Lesson starter

{panel type="general"}

# Notes on resources


For this activity you will need to print out Pixel Painter worksheets:

  - Print enough for one page per child.
  - For this activity use the *Black and White (2 possible binary values)* colouring option. Choose the first option in the *Colouring type* list
  - The first time you do this activity choose either the *Kauri tree* or *Butterfly* option in the *Image* list. Children can move on to the large images in the future.


Children will need:

  - A black pencil, colouring pencil, crayon, or felt tip pen.
  - Erasers if they are using pencils. It's not necessary for every child to have one, but it is useful to have them incase students make mistakes when colouring in.

{panel end}

Put students into groups of 6. If there aren't enough students to have all full groups then this can be done with groups of 2 or 3 instead.



Teacher: Computer screens are divided up into a grid of small squares, which we call picture elements, or pixels. *Instructions on writing "picture elements" then changing to pixels*.
Each of these pixels can be a different colour, and they can display different images.
In a black and white image, each pixel can be either black or white.


{image file-path="img/topics/letter-zooming-to-pixels.png" alt="Three images of the lower case letter 'a' are shown. These progressively zoom in to show the individual black and white squares which make up the letter on the screen."}

{image file-path="img/topics/pixel-visible-grid-with-letter-and-numbers.png" alt="A six by five grid is shown. Some of the squares are white and others are coloured black to create the shape of the letter 'a'. To the right of each row of squares there are five binary digits which describe the image."}

A 0 indicates a white square and a 1 indicates a black square.


## Lesson activities

- Colouring each image and putting them in order.




## Applying what we have just learnt
- Creating your own. Use grid printable, colour in and then read the numbers out to another child (or group).




## Lesson reflection


This is just for black and white images, why can't we do more than two colours with this activity?

  - If we can only use one binary digit for each we can only represent two different colours.
  This means each pixel can only be one of two different colours.

What could we do to represent more colours?

  - If we want each pixel to be able to show more colours other than black and white then we need to use more numbers (or binary digits) to represent the colour of each pixel. This will be explored in future lessons.

{comment Come back and split lessons later once all the other content is done}

We will explore this at older ages.
