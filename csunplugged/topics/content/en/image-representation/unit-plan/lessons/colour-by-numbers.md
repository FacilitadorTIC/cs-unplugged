# Colour by numbers

{comment Do learning outcomes at some point. They go in the yaml file}

## Key questions

- How do you think computers display images on a screen?
- How do computers represent images when they can only store numbers?


## Lesson starter

# Notes on resources

For this activity you will need to print out Pixel Painter worksheets:

  - Print enough for one page per child, and spare copies in case of mistakes.
  - For this activity use the *Black and White (2 possible binary values)* colouring option. Choose the first option in the *Colouring type* list
  - The first time you do this activity choose either the *Kauri tree* or *Butterfly* option in the *Image* list. Children can move on to the large images in the future.


Children will need:

  - A normal writing pencil. They can also use a black pencil or felt tip pen, but easily erasable pencils are preferable.
  - Erasers.

Say to the students: Computer screens are divided up into a grid of small squares, each of which can display a colour.
We call these squares picture elements, or pixels.

Write the words "picture elements" on the board.
To show how we get the word pixels, circle the "pi" of picture and the "el" of elements, and write "pixel" underneath.

Say to students: Each of these pixels can be a different colour, and when we have a lot of them on a screen they form an image.
Has anyone heard of pixels before? What about megapixels?

# Teaching observations

Megapixel means one million pixels.
Students may have heard the term "megapixels" used before because cameras are often described as being a certain number of megapixels, for example a phone with a 12-megapixel camera.
This describes the resolution of the photos a camera can take. A 12-mega pixel camera can produce an image with 12 million pixels in it.

Television screens are also made up of pixels.
Every image we see on a screen, whether it is a picture, a video, or text, is shown using pixels.
For example, if we want to display the letter *a* we can divide it into squares.
If we zoom in further and further on the letter we can see a grid of pixels similar to these:

{image file-path="img/topics/letter-zooming-to-pixels.png" alt="Three images of the lower case letter 'a' are shown. These progressively zoom in to show the individual black and white squares which make up the letter on the screen."}


In a black and white image, each pixel can be either black or white.


*explanation of images/pixels being stored using numbers, e.g. binary digits. How these can be converted to the colour of each pixel.*


A 0 indicates a white square and a 1 indicates a black square.


{image file-path="img/topics/pixel-visible-grid-with-letter-and-numbers.png" alt="A six by five grid is shown. Some of the squares are white and others are coloured black to create the shape of the letter 'a'. To the right of each row of squares there are five binary digits which describe the image."}



## Lesson activities

Put students into groups of 6. If there aren't enough students to have all full groups then this can be done with groups of 2 or 3 instead.

Now we are going to take binary digits and create images from these.

- Colouring each image and putting them in order.

- Advise students to colour the squares in lightly at first so it is easy to erase mistakes. They can colour the squares in darker later if they want to.



## Applying what we have just learnt

- Creating your own. Use grid printable, colour in and then read the numbers out to another child (or group).

- Whole class one using the bigger images.




## Lesson reflection


This is just for black and white images, why can't we do more than two colours with this activity?

  - If we can only use one binary digit for each we can only represent two different colours.
  This means each pixel can only be one of two different colours.

What could we do to represent more colours?

  - If we want each pixel to be able to show more colours other than black and white then we need to use more numbers (or binary digits) to represent the colour of each pixel. This will be explored in future lessons.

(We will explore this at older ages.)
