# Notes on resources

- Print spare copies of each worksheet in case students make mistakes and need a new one.
- Use the **Black and White (2 possible binary values) in in Run Length Encoding** option.
- Students can use a black colouring pencil, crayon, or felt tip pen, but easily erasable pencils work much better for the first time students do this activity.
